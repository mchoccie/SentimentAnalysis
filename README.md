# SentimentAnalysis
This was a university group (pairs of 2) project which I had a lot of fun doing because of my interests in NLP. The aim was to compare different neural network architectures to determine effectiveness of sentiment prediction. I compared simple RNN, LSTM and LSTM + CNN neural networks to see which model yielded a higher accuracy. I was interested in learning about how word embeddings worked too, so I went beyond and used two popular word embedding models in Word2Vec and GLOVE to see how the accuracy changed. The entire project was written in Python code and I used the NLTK and Keras libraries. I wrote a report outlining my findings that can be found in SentimentAnalysisReport.pdf

## How to run
You can run each individual code block in the notebook. Please change the file paths to fit wherever your data set is located. I ran the entire set up using Google Colab.
